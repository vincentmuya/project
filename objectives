-Self-Aware AI

Consideration And Goals of the AI

-Machine Learning Predictions – Using TensorFlow for tasks like price predictions, demand forecasting, or trend analysis.
-Natural Language Processing (NLP) – AI that understands and processes text, such as chatbots, sentiment analysis, or document summarization.
-Computer Vision – AI for image recognition, object detection, or facial recognition.
-Recommendation Systems – AI that suggests products, music, or content based on user behavior.

Best approach is to start simple and gradually add more complexity.

Suggested Roadmap:
Step 1: Machine Learning Predictions (Least Complex)
We can start with regression-based predictions, such as house price prediction or basic trend forecasting.

Step 2: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Once comfortable, we move to text classification, like sentiment analysis or spam detection.

Step 3: Recommendation Systems
Using collaborative filtering or deep learning, we can build an AI that suggests vendors, products, or content.

Step 4: Computer Vision (Most Complex)
Finally, we integrate image recognition or object detection, such as identifying event images or verifying IDs.

Types of ML Predictions

Regression (Predicting Continuous Values)
Used when predicting numerical values (e.g., price prediction, temperature forecasting).
Example: Predicting house prices based on location, size, and amenities.
Common Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks.

Classification (Predicting Categories)
Used when predicting categories (e.g., spam vs. non-spam, fraud detection).
Example: Email spam detection (Spam or Not Spam).
Common Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Deep Neural Networks.

Time Series Forecasting
Used when predicting future trends based on past data (e.g., stock prices, sales forecasting).
Example: Predicting next month’s electricity consumption.
Common Algorithms: ARIMA, LSTMs, Transformer Models.

Anomaly Detection
Used when identifying unusual patterns in data (e.g., fraud detection, network security).
Example: Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.
Common Algorithms: Autoencoders, Isolation Forests.

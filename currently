Types of ML Predictions

-Regression (Predicting Continuous Values)
Used when predicting numerical values (e.g., price prediction, temperature forecasting).
Example: Predicting house prices based on location, size, and amenities.
Common Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks.

-Classification (Predicting Categories)
Used when predicting categories (e.g., spam vs. non-spam, fraud detection).
Example: Email spam detection (Spam or Not Spam).
Common Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Deep Neural Networks.

-Time Series Forecasting
Used when predicting future trends based on past data (e.g., stock prices, sales forecasting).
Example: Predicting next month‚Äôs electricity consumption.
Common Algorithms: ARIMA, LSTMs, Transformer Models.

-Anomaly Detection
Used when identifying unusual patterns in data (e.g., fraud detection, network security).
Example: Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.
Common Algorithms: Autoencoders, Isolation Forests.

üìå Steps to Build the Loan Eligibility Prediction Model
1Ô∏è‚É£ Define the Problem Statement
We will predict whether a loan application should be approved (Yes) or rejected (No) based on the following features:

Applicant Income
Loan Amount Requested
Credit Score
Employment Status
Existing Debts
2Ô∏è‚É£ Collect & Prepare Data
We need sample data with the above features and the loan approval outcome (Yes/No). I will generate a small dataset for training.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Train a Machine Learning Model
We will use Logistic Regression (a simple yet effective classification algorithm).
Other possible models:

Random Forest üå≥ (Better accuracy, more complexity)
Neural Network ü§ñ (More advanced)
4Ô∏è‚É£ Integrate with Django API
Create a /api/predict_loan_eligibility/ endpoint.
Load and use the trained model inside Django views.
Allow users to input loan details via the API and get predictions.
